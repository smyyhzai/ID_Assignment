# **Project Name: SUMAYYAH'S PORTFOLIO**

## The user audience intent and purpose

Targetting potential employers, hirers, or just passersby, through a simply put together portfolio. Users can view the website portfolio through their phone browser or desktop.

This fully responsive website is easy to navigate through, and provides an ample amount of information about me.

# **RATIONALE**

## Who the website is catering for?

The overview of my website is to allow potential employers to find out more about myself as an employee.

## Value that it is providing to users

This portfolio showcases an introduction of myself, my academical background, my skills, work experiences and some projects that I've worked on in a simply designed website.

## What is the website catering for?

I have decided to create a portfolio website because I believe it would prove to be useful and beneficial for me in the future. As a student, an informative and good looking portfolio is essential for employers to gain an easy and brief background of myself for when I would enter into the working field.

Moreover as an IT student, this portfolio could become one of the projects that I would showcase and present as one of my abilities.

# **DESIGN PROCESS**

Focusing on my target audience, which are the employers, I went for a simple and intuitive webiste as the basis of my portfolio.

1. Initially designing a wireframe using Adobe XD, i drafted my website in a desktop view and mobile view to get a picture of what I would like to create. The number of pages, the content required, the tags I would include, and much more.

<<<<<<< HEAD 2. Next, I began creating the index page which would contain my the home/landing page of my website. I coded using Visual Studio Code.

3. Then, I realized I should have collected a number of suitable images first before beginning my page. Thus, I downloaded header/footer images and included images of my projects, that I would like to showcase in my page for visualization and aesthetic purposes.

Images can be viewed in the GitHub folder here: https://github.com/smyyhzai/ID_Assignment/tree/main/images
