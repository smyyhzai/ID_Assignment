# **Project Name: SUMAYYAH'S PORTFOLIO**

### The user audience intent and purpose

Targetting potential employers, hirers, or just passersby, through a simply put together portfolio. Users can view the website portfolio through their phone browser or desktop.

This fully responsive website is easy to navigate through, and provides an ample amount of information about me.

## **RATIONALE**

### Who the website is catering for?

The overview of my website is to allow potential employers to find out more about myself as an employee.

### Value that it is providing to users

This portfolio showcases an introduction of myself, my academical background, my skills, work experiences and some projects that I've worked on in a simply designed website.

### What is the website catering for?

I have decided to create a portfolio website because I believe it would prove to be useful and beneficial for me in the future. As a student, an informative and good looking portfolio is essential for employers to gain an easy and brief background of myself for when I would enter into the working field.

Moreover as an IT student, this portfolio could become one of the projects that I would showcase and present as one of my abilities.

## **DESIGN PROCESS(and features)**

Focusing on my target audience, which are the employers, I went for a simple and intuitive webiste as the basis of my portfolio.

1. Initially designing a wireframe using Adobe XD, i drafted my website in a desktop view and mobile view to get a picture of what I would like to create. The number of pages, the content required, the tags I would include, and much more.

   **View Adobe XD wireframe here:** https://xd.adobe.com/view/e10c8184-fc77-45cc-bdf2-0593a3847ad8-b45f/

2. Next, I began creating the index page which would contain my the home/landing page of my website. I coded using Visual Studio Code.

   **View code on GitHub:** https://github.com/smyyhzai/ID_Assignment

3. Then, I collected a number of suitable images first before beginning my page. Thus, I downloaded header/footer images and included images of my projects, that I would like to showcase in my page for visualization and aesthetic purposes.

   **Images can be viewed in the GitHub folder here:** https://github.com/smyyhzai/ID_Assignment/tree/main/images<br>

   **Each image is referenced in another section of this markdown.**

4. My website includes 5 pages altogether. The home page, about page, background page, project page, and contact page. Throughout all pages in the website, the navigation bar on top is fixed and scrolls along the page.<br>
   **Features and description of each page explained in a later section.**

5. Javascript added:

- navigation bar is fixed on top of the website
- submit button on form section, sends an alert to users
- current day, date, time on footer

#### **FEATURES**

**Home page:** Introductory page, contains arrow to navigate viewers to the other section of the page. This other section has 4 images which also navigates users to other pages on the website.

**About page:** Contains a gif of myself, brief summary of me, some software skills that I have acquired and finally some of my interests.

**Background page:** Shows my eduction history and work experiences.

**Project page:** Showcases my school and personal projects in a resposive grid gallery. Also provides viewers with a description of the project. Some projects include a link that directs viewers (upon clicking) to a different website opened in a new window.

**Contact page:** Offers viewers a form section where they can leave feedback, job offers, or even a hello. Additionally, returns a successfully sent message when the form is submitted.
